append_control_vectors: 0 # IF config["append_control_vectors"], THEN a new reference is used that includes the supplied reference and the 
# control vectors.

control_vectors: 1 # If config["control_vectors"], then the bed files for the controls be extracted and summarized in a plot in analysis/qc_vectors/control_vector_boxplot.pdf
# Only useful IF the ref genome included the control vectors with fasta headers ^J02459.1 (lamdba / unmethylated control) and ^M77789.2 (puc19 / methylated control). 
# The ref genome can be modified automatically to include these control vectors as the first two contigs by setting config["append_control_vectors"].
